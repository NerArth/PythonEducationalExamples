# Exercises
This is a collection of exercises for Python.

The correct answers are not given in the repository, as the point is to learn and understand the code, and this may be done in any way as long as it meets all the requirements of the exercise.

If confirmation is needed then you should consult with someone who is knowledgeable about Python.

The exercises are labeled with an expected level of challenge, and each exercise is numbered.

If you are using an IDE, you may want to turn off auto-completion/intellisense to prevent code suggestions from the IDE, if you want to figure out the code on your own.
