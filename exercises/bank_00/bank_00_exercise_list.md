# 1. Exercise. Variable Assignment Simple
Write code with 4 different variable assignments. You must demonstrate different types of data being assigned to each variable.
You may use the expected variable names or alter the names to your own.

# 2. Exercise. Conditionals Simple
Alter the code demonstrating how to make use of the built-in python function `print()` only when certain variables match the required conditions with the use of `if` and `then`.

# 3. Exercise. Conditionals Intermediate
Alter the code demonstrating how when required conditions are met, the code allows for an alternative action to take place if none of the conditions are met with the use of an `else`.

# 4. Exercise. Conditionals Advanced
Alter the code to demonstrate how "or" may be used in conditionals. You must not make use of an `else`.

# 5. Exercise. Loops Simple
Write code demonstrating the use of a `for` loop for incremental increase of a given variable.

# 6. Exercise. Loops Intermediate
Write code demonstrating how to use a `for` loop to calculate a total after several iterations, adding a fixed amount in each iteration and printing the running total.

# 7. Exercise. Collections Access Simple
Write code demonstrating how to access data within a given list.

# 8. Exercise. Collections Intermediate
Write code demonstrating how to add data to a given list.

# 9. Exercise. Collections Advanced
Write code demonstrating how to create a new list.

# 10. Exercise. Key-Value Pairs Simple
Write code demonstrating how to access the key-value pairs in a given dictionary.

# 11. Exercise. Key-Value Pairs Intermediate
Write code demonstrating how to update and add values in a given dictionary.

# 12. Exercise. Collections Access Advanced
Write code demonstrating understanding of given nested collections (lists and dictionaries) and showing how to access different levels of nested data. You do not have to use loops in this exercise.

# 13. Exercise. Collections Access Expert
Write code demonstrating understanding of given nested collections. You must demonstrate this with the use of loops.

# 14. Exercise. Classes and Objects Expert
In an exercise with a given dictionary, create a class representing the same data as the dictionary. The class needs to define a method (function) to alter its own parameters. You must call this method in your main body of code. You must therefore also demonstrate how a class is instanced as one or more unique object(s).
