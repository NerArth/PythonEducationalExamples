# 14. Exercise. Classes and Objects Expert
# In an exercise with a given dictionary, create a class representing the same data as the dictionary.
# The class needs to define a method (`def method_name(self):`) to alter its own parameters.
# You must call this method in your main body of code.
# You must therefore also demonstrate how a class is instanced as one or more unique object(s). 

# You MAY alter or remove the dictionary below as you see fit, but are not required to do so.

    # Write code here.
    # - You MUST create a class version of the given dictionary above. And you MUST create an instance of that class as an object.
    # - You MUST create a method to alter the object's parameters.
    # - You MUST add `print()` statements to show the relevant object's parameters before and after the method is called.
    # - You MUST call the method in your main body of code.
    #
    # You may create as many objects from your class as you see fit.
    # You may also use any other code you see fit to demonstrate your understanding of classes and objects.
