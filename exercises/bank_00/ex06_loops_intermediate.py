# 6. Exercise. Loops Intermediate
# Write code demonstrating how to use a `for` loop to calculate a total after
# several iterations, adding a fixed amount in each iteration and printing the current total after each iteration.
# This exercise requires you demonstrate you can assign new variables.

money = 600

# Write code here.
# - You MUST use a `for` loop.
# - You MUST add at least 1% to the variable in each iteration.
# - You MUST assign the result to a new variable; you may NOT alter the `money` variable.
# - You MUST iterate at least 12 times.
# - You do not have to print the original variable, only the new variable.

print(money)
